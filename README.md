Hex-clock
=========

My iteration on the hexadecimal color clock, which despite its name, counted in decimal and displayed as hexadecimal -- confusing at best.  I've updated it to actually count in hexadecimal.  That's probably unnecessarily confusing as a clock, but it bothers me to have decimal numbers displayed as if they're hexadecimal.  Probably, I'm just OCD.
